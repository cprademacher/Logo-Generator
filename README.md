# Logo-Generator

Generates a logo based on user input

## Description

- What was your motivation?
  My motivation was to create a simple app that allows user to be able to include a desired shape
  and three letters (as well as the colors for the text and shape) and it will produce a logo for them.

- What problem does it solve?
  My app solves the issue of having to hire a designer to create a basic logo for a small business.

- What did you learn?
  I learned how to integrate the usage of inquirer, constructors, and jest for testing.

## Installation

All a user needs to do to get the application running is open the terminal correlated with the index.js file and run 'node index.js' and answer the questions when prompted.

## Usage

After running 'node index.js' a user will simply answer the questions when prompted and once done
a new file will be created with the logo.svg.
